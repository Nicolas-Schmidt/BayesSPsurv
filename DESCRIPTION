Description: Bayesian parametric spatial split-populiation survival models for clustered event processes. 
             They account for both structural and spatial heterogeneity among "at risk" and "immune" populations, and incorporates time-varying covariates. 
	     This package currently implements Weibull, Exponential and Loglogistic forms for the duration component and facilitates the creation of spatial weights matrix objects 
	     from pount patterns by distance.
