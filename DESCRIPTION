Description: Bayesian parametric spatial split-population survival models for 
    clustered event processes. The models account for structural and spatial 
    heterogeneity among “at risk” and “immune” populations, and incorporate 
    time-varying covariates. This package currently implements Weibull, Exponential 
    and Log-logistic forms for the duration component. It also includes functions for 
    a series of diagnostic tests and plots to easily visualize convergence and 
    spatial effects. The user can also create their own spatial weights matrix 
    based on their units and adjacencies of interest, making the use of these 
    models flexible and broadly applicable to a variety of research areas.
