Description: Bayesian parametric spatial split-populiation survival models for clustered event processes. 
             The models account for both structural and spatial heterogeneity among "at risk" and "immune" populations, and incorporates time-varying covariates. 
	     This package currently implements Weibull, Exponential and Loglogistic forms for the duration component.  It allows for the creation of spatial weights matrix objects 
	     from point patterns by distance and presents a series of diagnostic tests and plots for easy visual diagnostics of convergence and spatial effects.
