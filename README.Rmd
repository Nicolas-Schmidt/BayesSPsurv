### Description
Parametric spatial split-population (SP) survival models for clustered event processes. The models account for both structural and spatial heterogeneity among "at risk" and "immune" populations, and incorporates time-varying covariates. This package currently implements Weibull, Exponential and Log-logistic forms for the duration component, and includes functions for a series of diagnostic tests and plots to easily visualize autocorrelation, convergence and spatial effects. The user can also create their own spatial weights matrix based on their units and adjacencies of interest, making the use of these models flexible and broadly applicable to a variety of  research areas.


### Installation

The latest version of the package (`0.1.1`) is available on [CRAN R](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BayesSPsurv):
```r
install.packages("BayesSPsurv")
```

To install the development version from GitHub:
```r
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Nicolas-Schmidt/BayesSPsurv")
```

### Example

### Data

We illustrate the functionality of `BayesSPsurv` using data from Walter (2015) that is included and described in the package. 

### Bayesian Spatial Split-Population (SP) Survival Model

`spatialSPsurv` estimates the Bayesian Spatial split-population survival (cure) model, which includes not only time-varying covariates but also spatially autocorrelated frailties in the model’s split and survival stage. To allow for easy replication, the examples below run a low number of iterations (N). 

`spatialSPsurv` Weibull model with N = 15,000 is [here](https://github.com/Nicolas-Schmidt/BayesSPsurv/tree/master/data-raw).

`spatialSPsurv` Log-Logistic model with N = 15,000 is [here](https://github.com/Nicolas-Schmidt/BayesSPsurv/tree/master/data-raw/data-raw-loglog).
